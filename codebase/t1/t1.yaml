# 1 deployment - 1~5 pod replicas - 1 flask server per pod
# 1 service to expose the deployment above
# constraints:
# pod anti-affinity: pod replicas distributed to different nodes
# preferred weighted node affinity: (1) powerful nodes; (2) non-backup nodes; (3) backup nodes
# (EXTRA) how to deploy pods to nodes with taints?
